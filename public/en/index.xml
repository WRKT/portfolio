      <description>Hey, the name&amp;rsquo;s Winness Rakotozafy, a passionate Linux enthusiast and DevOps engineer.
In my daytime, I work as a DevOps Engineer at a French data hosting company, Agora Calyce. On top of that, I&amp;rsquo;m also studying to obtain my Engineer&amp;rsquo;s degree at CNAM, where I&amp;rsquo;m focused on advancing my expertise in software engineering.
At night, I&amp;rsquo;m an active learner, keeping up with Cloud Native technologies, microservices, and new programming languages. My goal is to make my work life smoother, by automating, optimizing, and evolving constantly.</description>
