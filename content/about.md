Hey, the name's **Winness Rakotozafy**, a passionate **Linux enthusiast** and **DevOps engineer**.

In my daytime, I work as a DevOps Engineer at a French data hosting company, **[Agora Calyce](https://www.agoracalyce.com/)**. On top of that, I'm also studying to obtain my Engineer's degree at **CNAM**, where I'm focused on advancing my expertise in software engineering.

At night, I'm an active learner, keeping up with **Cloud Native** technologies, **microservices**, and new programming languages. My goal is to make my work life smoother, by automating, optimizing, and evolving constantly.

Currently, I’m seeking a **3-month software engineering internship** to further develop my skills, learn from diverse cultures, and strengthen my English communication to finalize my Engineer's degree.
